              <h3>Tree Planting</h3>
              <p>Trees are essential to a healthy environment. Through this activity, volunteers can help create green spaces in communities by planting a variety of native trees and plants. 
                This contributes to air purification, improves biodiversity, and provides long-term benefits for future generations. Whether you're experienced or completely new, 
                you’ll be guided by team leaders and supplied with the tools you need. Expect a fulfilling day of teamwork and growth—both in trees and in impact. 
                Join us and become part of something that lasts for decades, one tree at a time.</p>

              <h3>Coastal Cleaning</h3>
              <p>Plastic waste and debris along the coast not only pollute our oceans but endanger countless marine species. 
                This activity invites volunteers to spend a few hours clearing beaches of litter, sorting recyclables, and raising awareness about ocean conservation. 
                It’s a hands-on way to learn about marine ecosystems while making a real difference in preserving their beauty. Volunteers will be grouped in teams, with 
                guidance provided on how to safely collect and dispose of trash. Protect our shores, preserve biodiversity, and help ensure cleaner waters for generations to come.</p>

              <h3>Sidewalk Clean-up</h3>
              <p>Our sidewalks are often overlooked when it comes to environmental responsibility. This initiative aims to keep public walkways free from litter and debris. 
                Volunteers will assist in sweeping, trash collecting, and even repainting curbs in some areas. A clean sidewalk promotes community pride, improves accessibility, 
                and supports better public health. This event is perfect for those who want to give back locally with immediate, visible results. With every bag filled, your group 
                will help create safer and more pleasant routes for pedestrians and residents alike. Join us in making our streets shine.</p>
